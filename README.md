#  Football Field Segmentation Using Deep Learning

##  Project Summary

This project implements semantic segmentation on football match images using deep learning. The main objective is to identify and segment key elements on the fieldâ€”such as players, the ball, and the pitch itself. The project is built with **PyTorch**, and leverages a labeled image dataset from **Kaggle**.

| Model Variant         | Test Loss | Dice Score |
|-----------------------|-----------|------------|
| U-Net (Baseline)      | 0.2204    | 0.7432     |
| Modified U-Net        | 0.2268    | 0.6297     |
| Attention U-Net       | 0.2512    | 0.5806     |
|  ResNet-50            | 0.2274    | 0.6495     |
| ResNet-101            | 0.2300    | 0.5955     |

##  Conclusion

This project demonstrates that for football image segmentation, a well-tuned Baseline U-Net model can outperform more complex architectures such as Attention U-Net and ResNet-based U-Nets, especially on limited datasets. The hybrid Dice + Focal loss function effectively handled class imbalance, resulting in satisfactory segmentation accuracy.

The results highlight that model simplicity, combined with appropriate loss functions and training strategies, can yield strong performance even with small datasets. Future work could explore more advanced augmentation, backbone variations, and post-processing for further improvements.
